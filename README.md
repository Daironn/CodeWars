# CodeWars-Cpp-Python-C
CodeWars katas compressed in one repo

Here I track my progres on codewars.com

This repo is not for cheating and looking for completed katas if you do not know how to solve some task 
you can always check solution on the official website.

C++ folder is divided into two parts one is very old and I don't like how I handled solutions on windows.
C++ ver2 is new version, clear and handled on Linux
